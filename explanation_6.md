# Problem 6. Unsorted Integer Array

To solve this problem, I used two variables, min and max, to store the min and max values as we traverse/loop the
array. Min and max are initialised to the first element to the array. Once the loop is finished I return those values.

The runtime complexity is O(n) being n the number of the array.
The space complexity is O(n) being n the number of elements in the array.
